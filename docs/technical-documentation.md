# Technical Documentation – Portfolio Website

## 1. Project Overview

### Description
This project is a responsive single-page portfolio website developed as part of an academic assignment. The purpose of the website is to demonstrate foundational web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website presents personal information, selected academic projects, and contact details in a clean and structured layout.

---

## 2. Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structured semantic layout for content organization.
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout design, and responsive behavior using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Basic interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project management.

Each file is separated by responsibility to maintain clarity and modularity.

## Website Structure

### HTML Structure
The website is structured using semantic HTML elements to ensure clarity and readability:

- `<header>` – Contains navigation links.
- `<main>` – Wraps the main content.
- `<section>` – Separates major content areas.
- `<article>` – Used for project cards.
- `<footer>` – Displays footer information.

The layout is organized into three main sections:
- About
- Projects
- Contact

---

## CSS Architecture

- Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent colors and spacing.
- Implements Flexbox for layout alignment.
- Uses Grid for organizing project cards.
- Applies responsive design using media queries.
- Maintains consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.

The design follows a soft pastel theme with structured spacing and rounded components.

---

## JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript is used to:

- Enhance interactivity within the page.
- Handle basic dynamic behavior (such as navigation highlighting or form interaction, if implemented).
- Improve user experience through DOM manipulation.

All JavaScript code is written in a separate `script.js` file to maintain separation of concerns.

---

## Responsive Design

The website adapts to different screen sizes:

- Desktop layout with multi-column grid.
- Tablet layout with adjusted spacing.
- Mobile layout with stacked sections.

Responsive behavior is achieved using:
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries

This ensures usability across devices.

---

## How the Website Works

1. The browser loads `index.html`.
2. The CSS file (`styles.css`) applies layout and styling.
3. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) initializes interactive features.
4. Images and assets are loaded from the `assets/images` folder.
5. Navigation links allow smooth movement between sections.

---

## Code Organization & Quality

- Clear folder structure.
- Separated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Consistent indentation and formatting.
- Meaningful class names and organized styling.
- Version control maintained using Git.

---

## Conclusion

This portfolio project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental web development principles, responsive design techniques, and organized project structure. It reflects practical understanding of front-end technologies and proper technical documentation practices required for academic submission.
