## 5. Responsive Design

The website is designed to work on:

- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile devices

Responsive behavior is implemented using:
- CSS Flexbox
- Media queries
- Flexible width containers

Layout elements automatically adjust based on screen size.

---

## 6. JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website, such as:

- Handling form interactions
- Updating dynamic content (if applicable)
- Improving user experience with simple DOM manipulation

All scripts are written in a separate `script.js` file to maintain clean code structure.

---

## 7. How the Website Works

1. The browser loads `index.html`.
2. The HTML structure defines the layout and content.
3. The CSS file (`styles.css`) applies styling and responsive design.
4. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) adds interactive behavior.
5. All assets (images) are loaded from the `assets` folder.

---

## 8. Code Organization & Quality

- Files are separated by responsibility (HTML, CSS, JS).
- Clean and readable formatting is used.
- Meaningful folder structure is maintained.
- Version control is managed using Git.

---

## 9. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental front-end development concepts, structured project organization, and responsive web design. It reflects both technical understanding and proper documentation practices required for academic submission.
