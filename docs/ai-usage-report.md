# AI Usage Report: Portfolio Website Development

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a responsive personal portfolio website as part of an academic assignment. As a junior Software Engineering student with foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I used AI tools to support development, improve structure, and refine documentation.

The goal was to enhance my understanding of front-end development while using AI responsibly as a learning assistant.
